# Image Classification using IaaS Cloud Services

To build an elastic face recognition application using IaaS cloud resources from Amazon Web Services
that can automatically scale in and out based on demand.

The cloud based application takes in multiple images as input and runs a face recognition algorithm on it
to identify the underlying image. In this process, the core components of cloud computing are used which
include auto scaling, rapid elasticity, measured services, broad range network access, and resource
pooling. This problem is important as it addresses the most basic issue of auto scaling. This is finding an
importance in the technology industry currently as it minimizes the cost based on the usability of the
resources. In this project, explicit use of AWS EC2, SQS and S3 is made. The application is efficient in a
way that it is based on AWS free tier which scales up and down automatically.
